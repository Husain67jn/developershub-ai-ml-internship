# DevelopersHub Corporation – AI/ML Internship Tasks
This repo contains my submissions for the internship tasks (due Aug 14, 2025). I completed 4 tasks: Task 1 (Iris EDA), Task 3 (Heart Disease Classification), Task 6 (House Price Regression), and Task 2 (Stock Next-Day Close). Optional notebooks include a safety-conscious health chatbot and a small fine-tuning demo.
